# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to optimize the Canny edge detection automatic thresholding algorithm to improve the detection of the first boundary in image processing for smart car navigation. The current implementation uses Otsu thresholding on gradient magnitudes, but it needs enhancement to better identify the first significant edge boundary, which is critical for accurate lane detection and navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a smart car navigation system, I want improved first boundary detection in Canny edge detection, so that I can more accurately identify lane boundaries for navigation control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Canny edge detection algorithm processes an image row THEN the system SHALL identify the first significant boundary with improved accuracy compared to the current Otsu-based approach
2. WHEN gradient magnitudes are calculated THEN the system SHALL apply an optimized threshold that prioritizes the detection of the first boundary over noise suppression
3. WHEN multiple potential boundaries exist in a row or column THEN the system SHALL reliably select the first significant boundary based on gradient strength and spatial characteristics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a smart car navigation system, I want adaptive thresholding that considers local image characteristics, so that boundary detection remains robust under varying lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing different image regions THEN the system SHALL adapt the threshold based on local gradient distribution and image statistics
2. WHEN lighting conditions vary across the image THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent first boundary detection performance
3. WHEN the image contains noise or artifacts THEN the system SHALL distinguish between true boundaries and noise-induced gradients

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a smart car navigation system, I want optimized performance in boundary detection, so that real-time processing requirements are met without compromising accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimized Canny algorithm executes THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve processing speed compared to the current implementation
2. WHEN processing MT9V03X camera images THEN the system SHALL complete boundary detection within the existing timing constraints
3. WHEN memory usage is considered THEN the system SHALL not significantly increase memory footprint beyond current limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a smart car navigation system, I want configurable threshold parameters, so that the boundary detection can be fine-tuned for different track conditions and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threshold parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of sensitivity for first boundary detection
2. WHEN different track conditions are encountered THEN the system SHALL support parameter tuning without code recompilation
3. WHEN debugging or calibration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide access to intermediate threshold values and gradient information
